Personal - induction to / tinkering with -
[Scalaz](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz) based on [My scalaz-stream User
Notes](https://www.gitbook.com/book/aappddeevv/test_private_book/details) at
[Gitbook.com](https://www.gitbook.com/) and [Introduction to
scalaz-stream](https://gist.github.com/djspiewak/d93a9c4983f63721c41c).

## Run

To install dependencies and execute code, run `sbt run`. Program doesn't
output anything and is better run in an IDE while inspecting code in debug
mode.
